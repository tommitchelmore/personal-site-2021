                                I'm Tom, a student of Computer Science at the <a href="https://southampton.ac.uk">University of Southampton</a> in the UK.  Outside of my education, I enjoy all things Web Development and Systems Administration, with a strong interest in Cyber Security - I also enjoy volunteering and spending quality time with my good friends.

                        <p>
                            In 2020 I completed my A-levels (level 3) in Maths, Further Maths and Computer Science, being awarded an A in each.  For the duration of these courses, I also developed key personal skills such as organisation, teamwork and resilience.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout, I worked part time as a Team Member at a popular food retail chain, which provided me with experience working under pressure as part of a team while still providing a strong, positive customer experience.  This was, unfortunately, interrupted by the Covid-19 pandemic and meant that I was placed on "furlough" - with little else to do, I decided to really dive head first into web and systems development: I taught myself Javascript, C# (.NET) and a number of key popular technologies/packages including React, Discord.JS, MySQL, MongoDB and Web Assembly.
